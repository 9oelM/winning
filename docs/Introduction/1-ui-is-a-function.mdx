import { useState, useCallback } from 'react'
import { Math } from '../../src/components/Math.js'
import { Center } from '../../src/components/Center.js'
import { Linebreak } from '../../src/components/Linebreak.js'

So what is a function, and why is it so important that it needs to take up the whole page to be explained? Because UI as a whole, or any components, one by one, are functions.

## Back to the elementary school

Maybe it's a middle school, but whatever. You may probably have learned about a function.

A function receives an input (usually we call it X) and gives an output (usually Y). (We will define it more precisely in [the next page](2-pure-and-impure-functions))

<Math code='y=f(x)' />
<Linebreak />

Now, let's look at this little button example. 

```js
export const LittleButton = () => {
  const [text, setText] = React.useState(`initial text, `);
  
  const handleButtonClick = React.useCallback(() => {
    setText((prev) => `${prev} more text,`);
  }, []);
  
  return (
    <button onClick={handleButtonClick}>
      {text}
    </button>
  );
};
```

export const LittleButton = () => {
  const [text, setText] = React.useState(`initial text, `);
  const handleButtonClick = React.useCallback(() => {
    setText((prev) => `${prev} more text,`);
  }, []);
  return (
    <button onClick={handleButtonClick}>
      {text}
    </button>
  );
};

<Center>
<LittleButton />
</Center>
  

You do two things:
1. You **click on the button**.
2. Then the **text inside the button changes**.

Then, we could frame this as:

<Math code='LittleButton = f(text)' />, where `LittleButton` is purely the UI that you can see.

<Linebreak />

If we wanted to make it a bit more similar to the equation above, we could also write the code as:

```js
export const LittleButtonLogic = () => {
  const [text, setText] = React.useState(`initial text, `);
  const handleButtonClick = React.useCallback(() => {
    setText((prev) => `${prev} more text,`);
  }, []);

  return (
    <LittleButtonWithoutLogic onClick={handleButtonClick}>
      {text}
    </LittleButtonWithoutLogic>
  );
};

export const LittleButtonWithoutLogic = ({
  text,
  onButtonClick
}) => {
  return (
    <button onClick={onButtonClick}>
      {text}
    </button>
  );
};
```

Now let's look at `LittleButtonWithoutLogic`.

It receives `text` as an input and directly renders it, so it now looks more similar to <Math code='LittleButton = f(text)' />.

But what about `onButtonClick`? Isn't it also an input to the component? Yes, it is an input, but if we think carefully, we will find that it does not directly affect the UI, which is what's seen by the user. We would rather say that:

<Math code='text = g(previousText)' /> and
<Linebreak /> 
<Math code='UI = f(text)' />
